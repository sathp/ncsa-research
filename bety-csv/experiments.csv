ProMix BRK20 + 14-14-14 Osmocote pots; pre-filled by Hummert Sorghum seed
Conviron Growth House
LemnaTec moving field conveyor belt system
Scanalyzer 3D platform

# Procedures

## Planting

Plant directly into phenotyping pots 

## Chamber Conditions

Pre-growth (11 days) and Phenotying (11 days)
14 hour photoperiod
32 C day / 22 C night temperature
60% relative humidity
700 umol/m2/s light

Watering Conditions
Prior to phenotyping, plants watered daily
The first night after loading, plants watered 1× by treatment group to 100% field capacity (fc)
Days 2 – 12, plants watered 2× daily by treatment group (100% or 30% FC) to target weight
Automation

Left shift lane rotation within each GH, during overnight watering jobs
VIS (TV and 2 x SV), NIR (TV and 2 x SV) imaging daily
Recipes

Field capacity = 200% GWC (200 g water/100 g soil), based upon extensive GWC testing done by Skyler Mitchell
Target weight (fc) = [(water weight at % fc) + [(average weight of carrier/saucer) + (dry soil weight) + (pot weight)]
Water weight at 100% fc = dry soil weight * (%GWC/100)
Water weight at 30% fc = water weight at 100% fc * 0.30",,6000000004,44:28.5,16:46.2

A genomic resource for the development, improvement, and exploitation of sorghum for bioenergy.  Genetics 204: 21-33. ","BAP experiment with 350 accessions in 2 replicates.  
Planted in 2-row plots.  
Plot width = 152.4 cm (2-rows, row width of 76.2 cm).  
Planted length = 3.4 meters with 0.6 meter alley-way (total 4.0 meters for each plot).

The experiment is arranged in two replicates (blocks) as a row-column design with a further constraint that lines (accessions) are blocked by height class. This blocking is applied across ranges. Two ranges per replicate are assigned to short stature plants, and five ranges per replicate are assigned to medium stature plants. Thus in specifying a model for analysis, lines (accessions) are nested within height/stature classes.  In the field plan, field ranges represent rows, and field columns represent columns.
