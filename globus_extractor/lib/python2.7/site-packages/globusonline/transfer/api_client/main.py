Script for using the client in an interactive interpreter, e.g.

 python -i -m globusonline.transfer.api_client.main USERNAME -p

It creates a TransferAPIClient instance called "api" with the credentials
passed on the command line, which you can use to make requests.

 >>> print dir(api) # See a list of available methods.
 >>> code, reason, data = api.endpoint_list() # Test out endpoint_list.
 >>> api.set_debug_print(True, True) # Print raw request/responses.
 >>> code, reason, data = api.endpoint_list() # Run again with debugging enabled.
